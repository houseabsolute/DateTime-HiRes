DateTime::HiRes - Create DateTime objects with sub-second current time resolution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module enables you to generate DateTime objects that represent the current
time with sub-second resolution.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * now( ... )

Similar to C<DateTime-E<gt>now> but uses C<Time::HiRes::time()> instead of
Perl's C<CORE::time()> to determine the current time.  The returned object will
have fractional second information stored as nanoseconds.  The sub-second
precision of C<Time::HiRes> is highly system dependent and will vary from one
platform to the next.

Just like C<DateTime-E<gt>now> it accepts "time_zone" and "locale" parameters.
